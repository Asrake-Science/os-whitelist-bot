<h1>What do I do here??</h1>

if you plan on hosting this on a domain (which is very much recommended)

I suggest you use [ZeroSSL](https://app.zerossl.com/login), which is free

Once you've downloaded certificate, drag and drop the certificate.crt & private.key into this folder.

<h2> Important Note! </h2>

when registering your website on ZeroSSL, if you aren't using (www).YOUR-DOMAIN.xyz, <b> PLEASE state your subdomain!!! e.g (wls.yourdomain.com, whitelist.yourdomain.com) </b>
